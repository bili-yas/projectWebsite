				<h1>Top Music Bands that I relish:</h1>
									<!-- Radiohead -->
				<h2>1.Radiohead</h2>
				<h3>It grows on you...</h3>
				<div> 
					<center><img src="images/radio1.jpg" alt="BandRadio"></center>
					<p class="p1">
						They are the most three dimensional band I know. Every single song of theirs is 
						completely different to the rest. They are the most creative band I know, have 
						you seen their performance at the grammy's last year? They put so much effort 
						into every single song, Jonny conducted a whole orchestra (he made them sound like
						a traffic jam) just for less then 20 seconds in ONE song.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						 And their songs contain multiple meanings, you obviously haven't given thoughts 
						 to any of their lyrics, people think they are plain because they think Radiohead 
						 only creates songs with one meaning but they don't. They also don't keep on talking
						 about plain old love all the time. Thats the best part actually. They create interesting themes,
						 like in Kid A the theme was about the first human clone that already exists and going 
						 through the stages of life.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						I like how each album is different, and they aren't willing to just fall into making
						the same album over and over because people liked the last one. They don't care if 
						people don't like their music or if it's unexpected they just make what they want.
						And I like how each of their album just work so well like all the songs fit together
						and there's like a mood for the whole thing.

											<!-- Metallica -->
				<h2>2.Metallica</h2>
				<h3> The band that spawned a million imitators and inspired us all to shred!</h3>
				<div> 
					<center><img src="images/met1.jpg" alt="Metallica"></center>
					<p class="p1">
							Metallica is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles, California.
							Metallica was formed in 1981 when vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield responded
							to an advertisement posted by drummer Lars Ulrich in a local newspaper.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one 
						of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer.
						Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical 
						acclaim with its first four albums; their third album Master of Puppets (1986) was described
						as one of the most influential and heaviest of thrash metal albums.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						Time is the real test of an album’s significance. Even now, 35 years after their debut, only 
						one album is ever likely to beat Kill ’Em All and Ride the Lightning in a popular vote on metal’s
						greatest records – and that’s Master of Puppets, the third Metallica album, which turned four snotty,
						denim-clad hooligans in their early 20s into global superstars in 1986. By that point, of course, 
						Metallica were firmly on the road to mainstream acceptance. Those first two records, on the other 
						hand, will always belong to the scruffs, the outcasts, the Metal Militia.

											<!-- Pantera-->
				<h2>3. Pantera</h2>
				<h3></h3>
				<div> 
					<center><img src="images/pant1.jpg" alt="Pantera"></center>
					<p class="p1">
						Pantera’s music is like listening to chainsaws explode over a civil defense siren.
						It’s loud, scary and guaranteed to annoy anyone over age 30. Vocalist Philip Anselmo
						sounds like the psycho killer who makes flesh clothes in Silence of the Lambs. Vinnie Paul’s
						drums are machine guns heard above the screams of Dimebag Darrell’s ear-splitting guitar massacre.
						Rex No-last-name’s basslines are the footsteps of god or satan, pounding across a field of burned 
						and broken bodies. There’s nothing pleasant about Pantera music. It represents noise, fear and death... 
						with just a touch of Van Halen thrown in.

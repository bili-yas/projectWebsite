				<h2>1.Naruto: Fun And Action Filled</h2>
				<div> 
					<center><a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/naruto-shippuden" target='_blank'><img src="images/naruto1.jpg" alt="naruto evolution"></a></center>
					<p class="p1">
						Naruto is the story of battling ninjas, sure, but on the more personal level, 
						it's a story of growing up. At the start, the main three characters, Naruto, 
						Sakura, and Sasuke, are very much children.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						Over the course of the approximately five years of the story 
						(some of which are skipped in their entirety), all three struggle to 
						overcome their respective pasts. For Naruto, it is a battle against 
						all that comes with having been a lonely outcast for so long. For Sasuke,
						it is his inner battle with his need for revenge—to hunt down and kill the
						one who killed his entire clan. For Sakura, it's dealing with overcoming 
						her feelings of love in order to do what is necessary. It's through facing 
						these internal conflicts—as well as many external ones—that they enter into
						the realm of adulthood.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						Better still, their growth toward maturity is always a gradual change and 
						never a light switch. The events and revelations of the manga build on one 
						another to shape the characters—especially when it comes to Sasuke.

				<h2>2.Haikyuu!!</h2>
				<div> 
					<center><img src="images/haikyuu1.png" alt="Haikyuu!!"></center>
					<p class="p1">
						To be honest, I had my reservations about watching this anime. 
						I was quite hesitant to start-off with it and didn’t expect much. 
						I mean its volleyball, never had the slightest interest in it but
						for some reason, my instincts told me that I had to watch this anime,
						whilst the rest of me questioned what was so good about volleyball anyway.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						I was glad I went with my instincts because this anime turned out to be a gem.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						The story of Haikyuu is what amazes me the most. Its all volleyball 
						and yet I’m never tired of it despite not being an avid volleyball fan.
						The story follows Hinata Shoyo, a boy who desperately wants to play volleyball 
						and become like his idol, the little giant, who played nationals for Karasuno 
						High School when he was an elementary student. However, Hinata’s middle school
						didn’t have a volleyball team, so he spent most of his middle school life practicing
						on his own and in his final year he was able to participate in a tournament, thanks 
						to his friends who became his temporary team. In his very first match he faces Tobio
						Kageyama (The king of the court) and gets stomped. That is when Shoyo declares Kageyama
						to be his rival. As fate would have it, both of them end up at Karasuno High School after
						their final year. Rivals become teammates. The volleyball team at Karasuno High School
						has become a shadow of its former self, but with highly talented newcomers like Shoyo 
						(Speed and insane spikes) and Kageyama (Highly precise tosses) the team once again dreams 
						of going to the Nationals.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						Once the team starts to train together the story becomes a little predictable. 
						They follow a tournament format, meet powerful opponents and slowly rise to the top.
						However, the best part of the show is how unpredictable and intense the matches are.
						It keeps you on the edge the whole time. The series does a great job of balancing the 
						serious moments with comedy.

											<!-- Death Note-->
				<h2>3.Death Note</h2>
				<div> 
					<center><img src="images/Death1.jpg" alt="Death"></center>
					<p class="p1">
						Death Note tells the story of Light, a strikingly handsome and brilliant young 
						man who one day stumbles across a notebook belonging to an otherworldly creature
						known as a Shinigami -- a "god of death." Long story short, when you write a person's
						name in the book according to its specifications, that person dies. Rarely has a 
						"Death Note" fallen into the hands of a human, and no one in the past has used it 
						to any great significance. But Light is different. Light has a unique -- no, make 
						that psychotic -- sense of justice. He believes that he can truly make a better 
						world if he uses the Death Note to kill off the world's criminals. Before long,
						a string of mafiosos, murderers, and ne'er-do-wells winds up dead in inexplicable 
						fashion. The world knows Light only by the pseudonym Kira, based on a mispronunciation 
						of the English word "killer." But before long, Kira is the one name on everyone's lips.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						Having a rampant serial killer on the loose who murders by supernatural means 
						is of great consternation to world governments and police forces, if not average
						citizens who are aware that Kira is only disposing of criminals, not the law-abiding.
						Enter L, a genius young detective who has already worked on some of the world's most
						notorious cases. Unlike Light, L has no fashion sense, cradling himself into a near
						ball so he can think clearly, and though rail thin, he has a penchant for sweets.
						Except for their intellects, L and Light couldn't be more unalike. So when Light
						weasels his way onto the Kira investigation team and becomes L's only true friend,
						the game is truly afoot.
